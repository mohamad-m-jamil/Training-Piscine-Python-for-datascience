# Training Piscine Python for Data Science

## Overview

The **Training Piscine Python for Data Science** is a rigorous bootcamp designed to teach Python programming and data science fundamentals. This training program focuses on enhancing your Python skills while applying them to real-world data science tasks. Over the course of this bootcamp, you will learn key Python libraries, data analysis techniques, and gain experience in handling various types of data.

## Training Schedule

This bootcamp consists of daily challenges, exercises, and projects. Below is an overview of the first few days, which explain the daily activities and learning objectives.

### Day 1: Introduction to Python

- **Objective**: Get familiar with Python syntax and basic concepts.
- **Topics**: Variables, data types, basic operators, control flow (if, else, loops), functions, and input/output.
- **Exercises**: Write simple Python programs, such as calculating basic math operations, manipulating strings, and using control flow to solve problems.

### Day 2: Working with Data Structures

- **Objective**: Understand Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries).
- **Topics**: List operations, dictionary key-value pairs, looping through data structures, and handling lists of data.
- **Exercises**: Create programs that manipulate lists and dictionaries, such as sorting, filtering, and aggregating data.

### Day 3: File Handling and Data Processing

- **Objective**: Learn how to read and write files in Python.
- **Topics**: File input/output, working with CSV and text files, handling file exceptions.
- **Exercises**: Create scripts to read data from a file, process it, and write the results to another file.

### Day 4: Introduction to Numpy and Pandas

- **Objective**: Get familiar with the two most important libraries for data science: Numpy and Pandas.
- **Topics**: Numpy arrays, operations on Numpy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, and basic data manipulation techniques.
- **Exercises**: Load datasets into Pandas DataFrames, perform basic operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping data, and analyze simple datasets.

### Day 5: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

- **Objective**: Learn how to visualize data using Python.
- **Topics**: Introduction to data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Exercises**: Create various types of plots (line, bar, histogram, scatter), customize plots with titles, labels, and legends, and interpret visualized data.

### Day 6: Introduction to Data Science Concepts

- **Objective**: Understand the fundamentals of data science.
- **Topics**: Data cleaning, data exploration, and simple statistical analysis.
- **Exercises**: Write Python scripts that clean and analyze a dataset, apply basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and variance.

### Day 7: Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

- **Objective**: Get an introduction to machine learning algorithms and how to implement them using Scikit-learn.
- **Topics**: Basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, fitting models, and evaluating model performance.
- **Exercises**: Train a simple machine learning model on a dataset, evaluate its performance, and visualize results.

## Project Work

- After completing the daily exercises and challenges, you will work on a larger data science project. This project will require you to apply all the concepts you have learned so far, such as data preprocessing, exploration, visualization, and basic machine learning.
- The goal is to analyze a dataset, uncover insights, and present findings through data visualizations and machine learning models.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **IDE**: Any Python IDE (PyCharm, VSCode, etc.) or Jupyter Notebook
